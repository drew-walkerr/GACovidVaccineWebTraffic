# GACovidVaccineWebTraffic
This project is an effort to develop a flextable or shiny app to display current rates of COVID-19 vaccine location-based allotment/order numbers and clinic locations with clinic site web traffic, and county-level data on cases and deaths, with demographic information by county. Stretch goal would be to grab actual distribution rate of vaccines by county from GA DPH.
